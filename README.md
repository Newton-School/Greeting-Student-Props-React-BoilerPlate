# Greeting New College Students
## We are suppose to create a welcome page for new students when they login on our site.
The code is redundant so we choose to create a component that takes name as input and output a welcome message.


### Details
- Create a Child component using Child.js
- Use React functional component to do so.
- Output the welcome message "Hey <name>!"
- a prop named "name" will be passed to Child component.

### Acceptance criteria
- Welcome message should be as given in the 3rd point in Details section.
- Use of functional component.
